# Random_Name_Generation_Python

**Purpose**
This script creates a dataset of 4,100 fake English names (first + last names) to anonymize confidential information in data files. It helps in:
✔ Data Privacy Compliance 
✔ Secure Data Sharing (hiding real identities)
✔ Testing & Development for data analysis and visulizations (mock datasets)

**Features**

1. Uses Faker to generate realistic fake names.
2. Exports names to Excel (.xlsx).
3. Easily customizable (adjust name count, add more fake data fields).
